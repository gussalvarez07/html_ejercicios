    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>Sweet creature
        Had another talk about where it's going wrong
        But we're still young
        We don't know where we're going
        But we know where we belong
        And oh we started
        Two hearts in one home
        It's hard when we argue
        We're both stubborn
        I know, but oh
        Sweet creature, sweet creature
        Wherever I go, you bring me home
        Sweet creature, sweet creature
        When I run out of road, you bring me home
        Sweet creature
        We're running through the garden
        Oh, where nothing bothered us
        But we're still young
        I always think about you and how we don't speak enough
        And oh we started
        Two hearts in one home
        I know, it's hard when we argue
        We're both stubborn
        I know, but oh
        Sweet creature, sweet creature
        Wherever I go, you bring me home
        Sweet creature, sweetâ€¦</p>
