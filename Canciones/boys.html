    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>Ay, boy, whatcha say, boy?
        You tryna play coy like a Gameboy?
        Hit my phone boy, is you home boy?
        Are you alone boy? Come give me dome, boy
        Got a boy with degrees, a boy in the streets
        A boy on his knees, he a man in the sheets
        Sheesh, it's all Greek to me
        Got this boy speaking Spanish, ay Papi
        Baby, I don't need you
        I just wanna freak you
        I heard you a freak, too
        What's two plus two? (four, three, two, ow)
        Boys, boys, boys
        Make a girl go crazy (four, three, two, ow)
        Boys, boys, boys
        Make a girl go crazy (four, three)
        I like big boys, itty bitty boys
        Mississippi boys, inner city boys
        I like the pretty boys with the bow tie
        Get your nails did, let it blow dry
        I like a big beard, I like a clean face
        I don't discriminate, come and get a taste
        From the playboys to the gay boys
        Go and slay, boys, you my fave boys
        Baby, I don't need you (I don't need)
        I just wanna freak you (want, I want it bad)
        I heard you a freak, too (that's right)
        What's two plus two? (four, three, two, ow)
        Boys, boys, boys
        Make a girl go crazy (four, three, two, ow)
        Boys, boys, boys
        Make a girl go crazy (four, three, two, ow)
        Four, three, two, woo
        Boys, boys, boys
        Make a girl go crazy (four, three, two, done lost your mind)
        Boys, boys, boys
        Make a girl go crazy, ow
